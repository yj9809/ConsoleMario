Natural Accel/Decel Example (Concept Only)

Goal
- Make movement feel like it smoothly speeds up and slows down.
- Avoid instant stop and instant reverse at full speed.

State (per player)
- positionX (float)
- velocityX (float)
- accel (float)
- decel (float)
- maxSpeed (float)

Per-frame update (pseudo flow)
1) Read input direction
   - dir = +1 for Right, -1 for Left, 0 for none

2) Apply acceleration or deceleration
   - if dir != 0:
       velocityX += dir * accel * dt
     else:
       // apply friction toward 0
       if velocityX > 0: velocityX = max(0, velocityX - decel * dt)
       if velocityX < 0: velocityX = min(0, velocityX + decel * dt)

3) Clamp speed
   - velocityX = clamp(velocityX, -maxSpeed, +maxSpeed)

4) Integrate position
   - positionX += velocityX * dt

5) Convert to tile/screen position if needed
   - screenX = int(positionX)

Notes
- accel controls how fast you gain speed while holding a key.
- decel controls how quickly you slow down after releasing.
- Use higher decel than accel if you want snappy stop.
- For one-way camera (right-only), clamp cameraX to never decrease.

Example tuning (feel-based)
- accel: 30 to 80
- decel: 40 to 120
- maxSpeed: 8 to 18 (tile units/sec)

This is a conceptual guide; adapt to your current variables and style.
